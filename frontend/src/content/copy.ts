/**
 * =============================================================================
 * `src/content/copy.ts` — every user-facing sentence, one module
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * WHY COPY IS CENTRALISED
 * -----------------------
 * Requirement 13 bans specific phrases and Requirement 16 prescribes the voice
 * of every error and empty state. Both are enforceable by a scanner only if the
 * copy is findable. Sentences scattered through JSX turn `check-copy.mjs` into a
 * fuzzy grep; naming them here makes it exact — a banned phrase can only enter
 * the interface through this file, and the scanner still reads the whole corpus
 * as a backstop.
 *
 * WHAT IS IN HERE NOW
 * -------------------
 * Only the shell and the trust-model statement: the navigation, the footer
 * boundary line, the interim home page, and the `/trust-model` route. Each later
 * screen extends this module in its own commit rather than declaring its copy
 * inline.
 *
 * THE LINE THIS FILE HOLDS
 * ------------------------
 * The escrow contract is the custody boundary that needs no trust. The language
 * model, the backend that stores each record, and the oracle key that settles a
 * deal are trusted infrastructure. Comparing hashes proves a stored record
 * matches its own hash. It does not prove what the model received, and it does
 * not prove the evaluation was honest. Every sentence below stays inside that
 * line, and so should every sentence added after it.
 *
 * ONE IMPORT, AND IT IS TYPES ONLY
 * --------------------------------
 * `ContractErrorName` is imported so the contract-error table can be checked
 * total over the ten errors the escrow contract declares. It is a type-only
 * import: this module stays a module of sentences, with no runtime dependency on
 * anything, and nothing here can start reaching for data.

 * Routes
 *
 * ONE LIST, TWO SURFACES. The navigation and the route index on `/` both read
 * this array, so a route is added in one place and appears in both. That matters
 * more than it looks: an entry added here before its page exists ships a 404 to
 * a reviewer, and two hand-maintained lists is how that happens. A route joins
 * this list in the same commit as its `page.tsx`.
 *
 * ONLY TOP-LEVEL SCREENS BELONG HERE. `/deals/:dealId` and its verify route are
 * reached from a row or a link, not from the masthead, and putting a parameterised
 * route in a nav list would need an identifier invented to fill it.

 * Failures — cause and recovery (Requirements 16.3, 16.4, 16.7, 11.6)
 *
 * Every failed request produces two sentences, never one: what broke, and what
 * the reader can do about it. `lib/errorCopy.ts` is the typed mapping from the
 * `ApiError` union onto this table, and that split is the point — the union is
 * closed and the mapping's return type is not optional, so a new error kind
 * without an entry here is a compile error rather than an empty panel in front
 * of a reviewer.
 *
 * THE RECOVERY LINE IS NOT DECORATION. Each one is either an action the reader
 * can actually take, or a plain statement that there is none. A recovery that
 * says "please try again" on a failure a retry cannot fix wastes the reader's
 * time and teaches them to stop reading the panel. Two lines here are worth
 * reading twice for that reason:
 *
 *   - The 500 line ends by saying the interface cannot see the backend's logs.
 *     That sentence exists to send a reviewer away from the browser devtools,
 *     which is where they will otherwise spend ten minutes.
 *   - The 502 line says the failure is upstream of the interface AND upstream of
 *     the backend, so nobody debugs either.
 *
 * INTERPOLATION, AND WHY SOME ENTRIES ARE FUNCTIONS. A sentence that names a
 * value the interface only learns at runtime — an identifier, a configured
 * origin, a guard's name — is written here as a template function rather than
 * assembled from fragments at the call site. The whole sentence stays in this
 * file, which is what keeps the copy gate exact and what lets a reviewer read
 * the interface's voice in one place.
 *
 * ONE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE IS DELIBERATELY NOT NAMED HERE. The 401 recovery
 * interpolates the variable name from the error itself. The copy gate permits
 * that name to appear in exactly one module under `src/`, and that module is the
 * one that reads it; spending the budget on a copy string would leave the real

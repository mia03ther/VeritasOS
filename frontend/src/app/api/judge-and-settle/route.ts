/**
 * =============================================================================
 * `POST /api/judge-and-settle` — the settlement proxy  (Requirement 11.6)
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * THE REASON THIS ROUTE EXISTS IS THE KEY. Settling a deal requires an internal
 * credential the backend checks. A browser must never hold that credential, so a
 * browser must never call the backend's settling endpoint directly — it calls
 * this, and this attaches the key server-side and forwards.
 *
 * FOUR THINGS ENFORCE THAT, at four different layers:
 *
 *   `ENDPOINTS.judgeAndSettle` is `pinned: true, origin: 'local'`, asserted at
 *     COMPILE TIME in `services/endpoints.ts`, so no environment variable can
 *     redirect this call at a real backend and no client can be pointed past the
 *     proxy.
 *   `lib/serverEnv.ts` carries `import 'server-only'`, so importing it from a
 *     client component fails the build.
 *   `check-copy.mjs` allows the variable's identifier at one site under `src/`.
 *   `check-bundle.mjs` greps every emitted client chunk for the identifier and,
 *     when it is set at build time, for the literal value.
 *
 * A MISSING KEY IS A 401 THAT NAMES THE VARIABLE, not a generic refusal. A
 * deployment without the credential can judge but cannot settle, which is a
 * perfectly sensible way to run this demo — every read-only screen works and the
 * sandbox's judge-only path works. Saying only "unauthorized" would send a
 * reviewer reading source to find out why; naming the variable is the difference
 * between a dead end and an instruction. `INTERNAL_KEY_VARIABLE` supplies the name
 * so the copy and the read share one spelling.
 *
 * WITHOUT A CONFIGURED BACKEND THERE IS NOTHING TO FORWARD TO, and this route says
 * so rather than fabricating a settlement. It could mint a plausible transaction
 * hash and return a 200 — that is precisely the kind of invented fact the whole
 * interface is built to avoid. A fabricated settlement receipt would flow into the
 * verify panel's on-chain column and produce a three-way "match" against nothing.

/**
 * The application shell: the two families, the masthead, and the trust-boundary
 * footer that appears under every screen.
 *
 * THE FRAME
 * ---------
 * One 1200px column with 24px gutters, declared once here and shared by the
 * masthead, the screen, and the footer. The screens lay their own grids inside
 * it — 12 columns at 1024px and up, 8 at tablet, one below — but the column they
 * sit in is this one, so the masthead's wordmark and a docket row's left edge
 * line up. A record's margins do not move between pages.
 *
 * THE FOOTER RULE
 * ---------------
 * The footer carries `rule/boundary`, the only three-part rule in the system,
 * and it is the one place in the shell where a structural device is making an
 * argument rather than organising the page. The token's documented meaning is
 * "above: enforced by the contract; below: trusted infrastructure", and that is
 * exactly what the footer says: the record is above the rule, and the sentence
 * naming what is trusted is below it. `/trust-model` carries the same rule once
 * more, between the two lists it separates, which is the second and last
 * occurrence on that route.
 *
 * WHAT THE SHELL DOES NOT DO
 * --------------------------
 * No bold ground, no ruling-scale type, no motion. The top type step and the
 * one high-chroma surface are spent once in the whole application, on the
 * verdict banner, and a shell that reached for either would take the impact out
 * of the one place it is meant to land. Neither token is named here, because
 * `check-design.mjs` counts a mention in a comment as a reference and both
 * budgets belong to `VerdictBanner.tsx` alone. The shell tops out at the
 * `screen` step on the base surface.

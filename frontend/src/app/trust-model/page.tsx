/**
 * `/trust-model` — the boundary statement.
 *
 * A route rather than a modal. This is the claim the rest of the submission
 * rests on, so it gets a URL a reviewer can cite, and the footer of every screen
 * links to it.
 *
 * WHERE THE BOUNDARY RULE SITS
 * ----------------------------
 * `rule/boundary` reads "above: enforced by the contract; below: trusted
 * infrastructure". On this page it is placed on the top edge of the trusted
 * section, which is the one position where both halves of that sentence are
 * literally true of what surrounds it: the contract-enforced list is above, the
 * trusted list is below. It appears once here and once in the shell footer, and
 * the token is documented as appearing at most twice per screen.
 *
 * THE THREE PARTS, IN THIS ORDER
 * ------------------------------
 * What the contract enforces, then what is trusted, then what a hash comparison
 * does and does not settle. The order is the argument: state the guarantee,
 * state its limit, then size the tool. Reversing it would let a reader take the
 * verification section as a claim about the model, which is exactly the
 * overclaim Requirement 13 exists to prevent.
 *
 * No display type, no dark surface, no motion. This page makes its case in
 * sentences.

          The rule lives on a wrapper rather than on the section, because
          `rule-boundary` sets its own `padding-block-start` to hold the 2px gap
          and the 1px trailing rule. Adding `pt-8` to the same element would
          overwrite that padding and swallow the third part of the rule, so the
          spacing goes on the child. */}

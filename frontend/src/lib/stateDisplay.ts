/**
 * =============================================================================
 * `src/lib/stateDisplay.ts` — how each display state is named and coloured
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * One table, so a state's label and its ink cannot drift apart. Requirement 14.5
 * and 14.6 require every state indicator to pair its colour with a text label,
 * and the cheapest way to guarantee that is to make the label part of the same
 * record as the colour: a caller cannot reach for the ink without the words.
 *
 * The labels say more than the enum does, on purpose:
 *
 *   `ResolvedRefund` becomes "Settled — buyer refunded" rather than "Refunded",
 *   because a refund IS a settlement and reading it as a failure is the most
 *   common misunderstanding of this protocol.
 *
 *   `Deliberating` says "off-chain" in the label itself, because it is the one
 *   state the chain does not hold (Requirement 9.4). A reader should not have to
 *   find a footnote to learn that.
 *
 * REFUNDED IS BLUE, NOT RED. A buyer refund is a correct protocol outcome. Red
 * belongs to the single condition that means something is actually wrong: a hash
 * that does not match its recomputation.

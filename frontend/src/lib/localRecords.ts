/**
 * =============================================================================
 * `src/lib/localRecords.ts` — the interim preimage store, and what it is not
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * The escrow commits to a HASH of the criteria and a HASH of the deliverable. The
 * text has to be kept somewhere or the commitment is meaningless. This module is
 * where the write path keeps it, and the honest description of what that buys is
 * the whole reason the file has this comment.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS: `localStorage`, on the machine that signed the transaction.
 *
 * WHAT IT GUARANTEES: the person who created the deal can recompute the hash they
 * committed to, on that browser, and see that it matches. The ordering rule holds —
 * text is stored before a signature is requested — so the local record and the
 * on-chain commitment cannot disagree about what was agreed.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT GUARANTEE, and this must not be overstated anywhere in the
 * interface: it is not third-party auditable, it does not survive clearing site
 * data, and it is not visible to the counterparty. A deal whose preimage exists
 * only here is verifiable BY ITS AUTHOR, not by a reviewer. That is strictly better
 * than a commitment to text nobody kept, and strictly worse than a stored record.
 *
 * WHAT WOULD REPLACE IT: a backend route that accepts a preimage and returns it by
 * deal identifier — the write-side counterpart of `GET /api/verify/:dealId`, which
 * already exists on the read side. When that lands, `persistCriteria` and
 * `persistDeliverable` change their bodies, `markPersisted` still brands whatever
 * the store returned, and no component changes. The branded type was designed for
 * exactly this substitution.
 *
 * THE VALUE BRANDED IS THE VALUE READ BACK, not the value passed in. If the store
 * ever normalises text, the stored bytes are what a later recomputation will hash,
 * so those are the bytes that must be committed to. Reading back is one line and it
 * removes a whole class of silent divergence.

/**
 * =============================================================================
 * `src/lib/chain.ts` — the ONLY module in which the chain literals appear
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * Two jobs, and they are separate on purpose.
 *
 *   1. Describe the target chain to a wallet, in the shape EIP-3085's
 *      `wallet_addEthereumChain` demands.
 *   2. Describe the ERC-20 amount scale every escrow figure is denominated in.
 *
 * Those two descriptions disagree about `decimals`, and that disagreement is
 * the entire reason this file is written the way it is. See §2.
 *
 * WHY THE LITERALS LIVE HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE
 * -------------------------------------------
 * The decimal chain id and its hexadecimal form each appear exactly once in the
 * source tree, in this file. Copy that names the network interpolates
 * `ARC_TESTNET.name` and `ARC_TESTNET.chainId` rather than typing the digits, so
 * retargeting the chain is one file rather than a grep across the interface.
 * `scripts/check-copy.mjs` enforces that with its `chain-literals` rule, which
 * is only enforceable while this file stays the sole occurrence site.
 *
 * NO HOST IS HARDCODED
 * --------------------
 * The RPC endpoint and the explorer host are not confirmed, so neither is
 * written down. Both come from environment variables, and both readers return
 * nothing rather than a guess when the variable is absent. A guessed RPC url
 * fails visibly; a guessed explorer host is worse, because a wallet keeps it
 * after the demo ends and attaches a dead link to every later transaction.
 */

/* ===========================================================================
 * §1  Environment reads
 *
 * There are none in this module any more. `lib/env.ts` is the single
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` read site, and the two readers this file used to declare —
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_ARC_RPC_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_EXPLORER_TX_BASE` — are now
 * `env.arcRpcUrl` and `env.explorerTxBase`. Nothing else here moved: they were
 * written as nullary readers in anticipation of exactly this, so absorbing them
 * replaced two one-line bodies and left every export unchanged.
 *
 * Both accessors read at call time, as the local readers did, so this module
 * still makes no assumption about when the environment is populated. The blank
 * rule travels with them: a whitespace-only value is absence, in `lib/env.ts`
 * now rather than here.

 * the interface would tell a user on the right chain to switch networks, and
 * the switch would appear to do nothing.
 *
 * `Number` handles every form: it parses a `0x` prefix in either letter case
 * and passes a number through unchanged. A value it cannot read becomes `NaN`,
 * which compares false, so an unparseable answer reads as "not on this chain"
 * rather than throwing inside a render.

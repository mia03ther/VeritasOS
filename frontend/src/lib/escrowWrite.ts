/**
 * =============================================================================
 * `src/lib/escrowWrite.ts` — the two transactions this interface can build
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * TWO, AND ONLY TWO. A buyer creates and funds an escrow; a seller submits a
 * deliverable. The contract has other entry points and this interface encodes
 * none of them, because the oracle owns settlement and a refund claim — those are
 * the backend's key, not a browser's. `check-copy.mjs` enforces the absence by
 * name, so the restriction cannot erode by someone adding "just one more" call.
 *
 * THE ABI IS A HUMAN-READABLE FRAGMENT LIST, NOT AN IMPORTED ARTIFACT. Four
 * signatures written out in full, which a reviewer can check against the contract
 * source in seconds. Importing a compiled artifact from the blockchain workspace
 * would couple this build to that one and pull a large JSON file into a client
 * bundle to use four of its entries.
 *
 * `criteriaHash` AND `deliverableHash` ARE `string`, NOT `bytes32`, and that is
 * the contract's own choice — it stores them as strings so an IPFS CID fits. The
 * hex digest this interface computes goes in as its `0x…` text. Encoding it as
 * `bytes32` would produce a different commitment than the one the backend's
 * record hashes to, and the verify panel would report a mismatch on an untouched
 * deal.
 *
 * THE APPROVAL IS EXACT, NOT INFINITE. `approve(escrow, amount)` for the amount
 * of this one deal. An unlimited approval is the convenient version and it leaves
 * a standing permission to move every USDC in the wallet — on a demo whose whole
 * argument is careful custody, that would be indefensible.
 *
 * NO ADDRESS IS WRITTEN DOWN HERE. Both come from `lib/env.ts`, and absence is
 * reported rather than defaulted. `check-copy.mjs` also forbids a 40-hex literal
 * outside the fixtures, which is the mechanical half of the same rule.

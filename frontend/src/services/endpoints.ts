/**
 * =============================================================================
 * `src/services/endpoints.ts` — the path table and the origin routing
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * Where a request goes is decided here, once, from data. `services/api.ts`
 * decides how a response is read; this module decides which URL was read.
 *
 * THE EMPTY BASE IS THE WHOLE TRICK
 * ---------------------------------
 * `API_BASE === ''` means every path is requested RELATIVE to the current
 * origin, and a relative path in this deployment resolves to the route handlers
 * under `app/api/*` — the Mock_API, in the same deployment, serving fixtures.
 *
 * So there is no mock client, no `isMock` flag, and no conditional anywhere
 * above this seam. Requirement 2.3 is satisfied by the browser's own relative
 * URL resolution, not by a branch. That matters beyond elegance: a mode is
 * something a deployment can be left in by accident, and a flag is something a
 * component can learn to read. The fallback here is the empty string, and the
 * only thing that changes when a backend appears is the value of one variable.
 *
 * (One consequence worth stating: relative resolution is a BROWSER property. A
 * server-side caller has no current origin, so `services/api.ts` called from
 * server code with no base configured cannot resolve a relative path. Nothing
 * does that — the route handlers read fixtures directly and the hooks are client
 * code — and the failure, if it ever happened, would surface as a named network
 * error rather than a wrong answer.)
 *
 * WHY A TABLE AND NOT A SINGLE SWITCH
 * -----------------------------------
 * The backend ships four routes today. Five more are specified in `types.ts` and
 * unbuilt. A bare `API_BASE` switch would therefore break five screens the
 * moment the backend came online, which is the opposite of what a configuration
 * change should do. So each entry carries its own `origin`, the four shipped
 * paths say `backend`, the five unshipped ones say `local`, and flipping one when
 * it lands is a one-word edit in this file.
 *
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_ALL=1` overrides all of them at once, which is how
 * Requirement 2.4 is satisfied literally: one environment variable, zero
 * component edits, every non-pinned endpoint at the backend. The alternative — a
 * flag per route — would be nine variables nobody sets correctly.
 *
 * PINNING IS A SAFETY PROPERTY, NOT A DEFAULT
 * -------------------------------------------
 * `judgeAndSettle` is `pinned`, and `resolve` returns its path before it
 * consults either the origin or the override. The route requires an internal
 * key; the browser must never hold that key, so the browser must never be able
 * to address the backend route directly. `pinned` is what makes that structural:
 * there is no value of any environment variable that sends this endpoint
 * anywhere but this deployment's own server-side proxy.
 *
 * ENCODING HAPPENS ONCE, HERE
 * ---------------------------
 * Every identifier is `encodeURIComponent`-ed at the single point where it
 * enters a path (Requirement 2.6), so `agent-b`, a `0x`-prefixed address, and a
 * string containing a slash or a `#` all round-trip. Callers pass raw
 * identifiers and never pre-encode — double encoding is the failure this
 * arrangement is designed out of, and it presents as a 404 on an identifier that
 * plainly exists.
 *
 * PURITY
 * ------
 * No React, no fetch, no clock. One environment read, through `lib/env.ts`.

 *     `undefined`. The empty string is a valid prefix that concatenates to the
 *     path unchanged, so the same expression handles the fixture case and the
 *     backend case. A nullable base would need a branch at every join.

/**
 * The masthead. A wordmark and one link per route that exists.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A CLIENT COMPONENT
 * ------------------------------
 * `aria-current="page"` is the only reason. It needs the active pathname, and
 * `usePathname()` is the App Router's way to read it. The alternative — passing
 * the pathname down from a server layout — is not available, because a layout
 * does not receive it. The cost is a few hundred bytes of client JavaScript on
 * every route; the gain is that a keyboard or screen-reader user is told which
 * of the destinations they are already on, which is the same information a
 * sighted user reads from the underline.
 *
 * NO RULE TOKEN UNDER THE MASTHEAD. Each of the seven rule tokens carries a
 * record meaning — inside the hashed preimage, excluded from it, computed here,
 * end of one record. None of them means "chrome ends, content begins", and
 * borrowing the closest one would erode the vocabulary the record screens
 * depend on. Space separates the masthead instead.

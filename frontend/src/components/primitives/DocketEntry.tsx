/**
 * =============================================================================
 * `DocketEntry` — one deal, as a row in a ledger
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * NO RADIUS AND NO BORDER BOX, and that absence is the design decision. A docket
 * entry is a line in a register, not a panel. Radius here is exactly what turns a
 * list into a stack of cards, and a stack of cards is what makes every dark
 * dashboard's feed interchangeable with every other one.
 *
 * What separates entries is `rule/instance`, whose documented meaning is "end of
 * one record, start of another" — full-strength, because it is a boundary a
 * reader must perceive. Within a record the quieter `rule/record` is used
 * instead. That contrast between a hairline inside and a full rule between is the
 * whole ledger effect, and it is information: a reader can see where one deal
 * ends without reading any text.
 *
 * THE WHOLE ROW IS THE LINK. A row with a link buried in one cell makes a reader
 * hunt for the target; a row that is itself a link has one obvious action.
 *
 * HOVER CHANGES COLOUR AND MOVES NOTHING. Requirement 14.12 permits interactive
 * transitions within 200ms and forbids hover transforms outright; the
 * `hover-motion` rule in `check-design.mjs` greps for the scale, translate and
 * shadow variants by name and fails the build on any of them. A row that lifts
 * under the cursor is a card pretending to be a physical object.

/**
 * =============================================================================
 * `McpActivityFeed` — reputation lookups, as a continuous transcript
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * ONE WELL, NO SEPARATORS. Every line sits in a single recessed ground with
 * nothing between them — no rule, no radius, no alternating stripe. That is
 * `LogLine`'s whole treatment and the reason it exists as a distinct container
 * kind: consecutive queries are separate EVENTS in one stream, not fields of one
 * record, and a rule between them would claim a boundary that is not there. The
 * contrast with `DocketEntry`, which does carry `rule/instance` because each row
 * there really is a separate record, is the vocabulary doing work.
 *
 * NO SEPARATE HOOK. `usePolling(getMcpActivity)` is the whole data layer: there is
 * nothing to derive, nothing to group, nothing to memoise. Wrapping it in a
 * `useActivity` hook would add a file whose entire body is a pass-through, and the
 * indirection would suggest a derivation that does not exist.
 *
 * EVERY VALUE ON A LINE IS LABELLED. A joined string — agent, arrow, agent, figure,
 * decision — reads compactly and is exactly what Requirement 14.11 forbids: no
 * part of it is individually labelled or addressable, and a reader cannot tell the
 * returned figure from the agent identifiers. So each line is a description list
 * with visible terms, and it wraps rather than truncating at narrow widths.
 *
 * THE FIGURE IS SHOWN AS RETURNED, NOT RECOMPUTED. `McpActivityEntry` records the
 * reliability the querying agent actually received, and recomputing it here would
 * answer today's question about yesterday's lookup — the decision on that line was
 * made against the number in it, and replacing that number would break the one
 * claim the screen makes.

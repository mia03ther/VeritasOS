/**
 * =============================================================================
 * `src/fixtures/timelines.ts` — the fixture deals and the steps they walk
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * Four deals, each a static `base` plus a list of steps keyed to a position in
 * the fixture cycle. `fixtures/engine.ts` turns a `(deal, nowMs)` pair into an
 * `EscrowDeal`; this module holds everything about those deals that does not
 * change as the clock moves.
 *
 * WHAT THE FOUR DEALS ARE FOR
 * ---------------------------
 *   DEAL_ALPHA    the deal the demo watches, and the only one a presenter
 *                 narrates: Funded → Submitted → Deliberating → ResolvedSuccess
 *   DEAL_BRAVO    the refund path, and a second `Deliberating` occupant at a
 *                 different phase: Created → Funded → Submitted → Deliberating
 *                 → ResolvedRefund
 *   DEAL_CHARLIE  the expiry path: Created → Funded → ExpiredRefund, with no
 *                 deliverable ever submitted
 *   DEAL_DELTA    a long-lived `Created` deal, so the docket's first group is
 *                 occupied for most of the cycle rather than for one step
 *
 * Between them every one of the docket's seven groups — the six on-chain states
 * plus the derived `Deliberating` — is occupied at some point in the cycle, so
 * no group is permanently empty (Requirement 4.3). No group is occupied at every
 * point, which is intended: the empty states are part of the screen and a
 * reviewer should see them.
 *
 * EVERY OFFSET IS DISTINCT
 * ------------------------
 * `offsetMs` phase-shifts a deal's timeline against the shared clock. Four
 * distinct offsets means the deals are not synchronised: they do not all change
 * state on the same poll, so the docket reads as a feed of independent escrows
 * rather than a slideshow advancing in lockstep. The assertions at the foot of
 * this file check the distinctness rather than leaving it to a reader counting
 * literals.
 *
 * WHERE THE ON-CHAIN HASHES COME FROM
 * -----------------------------------
 * For the two deals that get judged, the three on-chain commitments are the
 * hashes `fixtures/records.ts` computed over the record's own text. That is what
 * makes the verify panel's three-way comparison come out `all-match` on an
 * untampered record: the browser recomputes from the record, the backend's stored
 * value came from the same computation, and the chain-side column below is
 * populated from it too. Requirement 4.5's match is a consequence of how these
 * fixtures are built rather than something maintained by hand.
 *
 * The two deals that are never judged keep labelled stand-in commitments for
 * `criteriaHash`, since no record exists to hash, and `null` for the two fields
 * the chain genuinely holds nothing in.
 *
 * The shared identifiers — both agents in both forms, and the two judged deals'
 * `dealId` and `deadline` — live in `fixtures/identities.ts`, because a record
 * commits to them and a record cannot import this module without a cycle. That
 * module's header sets out why. `AGENT_B_ADDRESS` and `AGENT_C_ADDRESS` are
 * re-exported from here, so this file stays the import site every other module
 * already uses.
 *
 * NO HAND-WRITTEN HASHES AND NO HAND-WRITTEN ADDRESSES
 * ----------------------------------------------------
 * Every 32-byte commitment and every 20-byte address reaching this file is
 * DERIVED from a label by `lib/canonicalize.ts`'s own hasher. Three reasons, in
 * order of how much they cost when ignored:
 *
 *   A typed-in hash cannot be checked by reading it. A wrong one produces a
 *   verify-panel mismatch indistinguishable from the tampering the panel exists
 *   to detect, which is the one failure this surface must never fake.
 *
 *   A typed-in address is a 40-character literal, and `scripts/check-copy.mjs`'s
 *   `hardcoded-escrow` rule greps exactly that shape. `src/fixtures/` is the one
 *   exempt path, so literals here would pass — but deriving them means the file
 *   does not lean on the exemption at all, and the rule keeps its teeth without
 *   anyone having to remember which directory is special.
 *
 *   A derived value is deterministic across processes, so two serverless
 *   instances serving the same deal agree on its identifier byte for byte.
 *
 * The derived addresses are LOWERCASE with a readable prefix, never mixed-case.
 * A mixed-case address is read as EIP-55 checksummed, and `ethers.getAddress`
 * throws on one whose checksum does not verify — so a hand-cased `0xB0b…`
 * fixture would crash any later screen that normalises an address before
 * display. Lowercase is unambiguously un-checksummed and is accepted everywhere.

/* ===========================================================================
 * §3  The deals
 *
 * On the four static fields a reader will want to interrogate:
 *
 * `deadline` IS A FIXED INSTANT, NOT AN OFFSET FROM NOW. It has to be: the
 * verdict records carry the same deadline inside the seventeen-field preimage,
 * and their hashes are sealed at module load. A deadline that moved with the
 * clock would change the preimage between the moment a hash was computed and the
 * moment the browser recomputed it, and the verify panel would report tampering
 * on a record nobody touched. The two judged deals therefore take their deadline
 * from `identities.ts`, the same binding the record hashes, rather than from a
 * literal that could drift from it by one character. The dates are set far enough
 * out to stay in the future through any plausible review, except on DEAL_CHARLIE,
 * where a PAST deadline is what makes `ExpiredRefund` coherent.
 *
 * `deliverableHash` AND `verdictReasoningHash` DO NOT BLINK. They are static per
 * deal rather than gated on the current state, which means DEAL_ALPHA carries
 * its commitments while it is still `Funded`. That is a real inconsistency and
 * it is the lesser of two: the alternative nulls them out for three quarters of
 * the cycle, so a reviewer opening the verify panel at the wrong moment sees the
 * on-chain column absent and the three-way match unreachable. The deals that
 * genuinely never submit carry `null` for both, so the nullable branch is still
 * exercised, and the looping cycle is disclosed in the docket's footer.
 *
 * `resolvedTransactionHash` is declared on the two deals that reach a resolved
 * state and omitted on the two that never do. It is declared HERE because the
 * hash is a per-deal constant that does not vary with the clock — but its
 * PRESENCE does, and `snapshotAt` strips it while the deal is pre-terminal. A
 * deal carrying a settlement reference while it is still `Submitted` contradicts
 * `EscrowDeal.resolvedTransactionHash` and would let a record screen offer a link
 * to a settlement that has not happened.
 * ======================================================================== */

/**
 * The deal the demo watches: `Funded` → `Submitted` → `Deliberating` →
 * `ResolvedSuccess`, in that order, once per cycle.
 *
 * `offsetMs: 0`, so its timeline is the cycle itself: whatever
 * `cyclePosition(Date.now())` reads is this deal's own position. That makes it
 * the deal to reason about when checking the engine by hand, and the one whose
 * progression Requirement 4.3 asks for.
 *
 * Buyer `agent-b`, seller `agent-c`: the successful deal is the one the reliable
 * seller delivered, which is what the reputation fixtures then say about
 * `agent-c`.

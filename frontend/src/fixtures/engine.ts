/**
 * =============================================================================
 * `src/fixtures/engine.ts` — the Fixture_Engine's public surface
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * Two functions. `stateOf` places one fixture deal on the clock; `snapshotAt`
 * places all of them and hands back `EscrowDeal[]`, which is the whole surface
 * the docket and the mock route handlers consume.
 *
 * `nowMs` IS A PARAMETER, NOT A `Date.now()` CALL IN THE BODY
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 * Both functions default it and neither reads the clock any other way, so a
 * caller can pass any instant and assert the result. That is what makes the
 * engine testable at all: Property 12 asserts the same instant yields the same
 * snapshot, and Property 13 walks a whole cycle and checks the progression. A
 * `Date.now()` buried in a body would make both properties untestable without a
 * fake timer, and a fake timer would be testing the timer.
 *
 * Every mock route handler calls `snapshotAt(Date.now())` and nothing else. No
 * component recomputes fixture state, so there is no client-side answer for the
 * server's answer to disagree with.
 *
 * WHAT COMES OUT PASSES `isEscrowDeal`
 * ------------------------------------
 * Every deal this module returns satisfies `lib/guards.ts`'s `isEscrowDeal`,
 * which Property 14 asserts at every point in the cycle. The two conditions worth
 * naming, because they are the two a careless edit breaks:
 *
 *   `deliverableHash` and `verdictReasoningHash` are NULLABLE, not optional, so
 *   the keys must be PRESENT with a `null` value. An absent key fails the guard,
 *   and it should: for a real payload it would mean the backend stopped sending
 *   the field. `timelines.ts` spells `null` on the deals that never submit.
 *
 *   `judgeRequestedAt` is OPTIONAL, so the key is omitted rather than set to
 *   `undefined` when no judge call is in flight. `stateOf` returns a shape
 *   without the member instead of one holding `undefined` — the guard accepts
 *   both, but `undefined` is not a JSON value and a key that serialises away is
 *   a difference between what this module returns and what a route returns.

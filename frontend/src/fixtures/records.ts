/**
 * =============================================================================
 * `src/fixtures/records.ts` — the verdict records, with their hashes computed
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * Two evidence records: one deal that passed and one that was refunded. Each is
 * the full off-chain material a judge produced — the criteria, the deliverable,
 * the prompt, the model's unedited answer, the reasoning — and each carries the
 * three hashes that commit to it.
 *
 * THE HASHES ARE COMPUTED, NEVER TYPED IN  (Requirement 4.5)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * `computeRubricHash`, `computeDeliverableHash`, and `computeVerdictHash` run
 * over this material at module load. A hand-written hash constant would be a
 * trap for three reasons, in ascending order of what they cost:
 *
 *   It cannot be checked by reading it. Sixty-four hex characters are sixty-four
 *   hex characters; nothing about looking at one tells you whether it is right.
 *
 *   It goes stale the moment a fixture's text changes by one character. Fix a
 *   typo in a deliverable and the constant is silently wrong.
 *
 *   The resulting Verify_Panel mismatch is indistinguishable from a real one. A
 *   false tamper alarm on an audit surface costs the credibility of every true
 *   one, so it is the single failure this file must never be able to fake.
 *
 * The cost is three keccak256 calls per record at import — microseconds — and in
 * exchange the fixtures are correct by construction and stay correct when
 * someone rewords a deliverable.
 *
 * `timelines.ts` reads `RECORD_COMMITMENTS` for the on-chain fields of the two
 * judged deals, so the chain-side column of the three-way comparison is
 * populated from these same computed values. Requirement 4.5's three-way match
 * is therefore a consequence of how the fixtures are built rather than something
 * maintained by hand.
 *
 * WHAT AGREEMENT PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
 * -------------------------------------------
 * Recomputing these hashes shows a stored record matches its own hash and the
 * commitment the contract holds. It says nothing about what the model was
 * actually shown, and nothing about whether the evaluation was sound. The prose
 * below is fixture material presented as evidence, not a claim that an
 * evaluation of this quality is guaranteed.
 *
 * THE PROSE IS WRITTEN TO BE READ CLOSELY
 * ---------------------------------------
 * These strings are the exhibits on the verdict record screen, at full length,
 * with no summarisation. A reviewer will read the criteria against the
 * deliverable and decide whether the verdict follows. Placeholder text would
 * make that impossible and would make the screen an empty frame, so the criteria
 * are specific enough to be checkable, the deliverable satisfies four of the
 * approved record's five criteria in a way a reader can confirm, and the refused
 * one fails its criteria in named, countable ways.

/**
 * The prompt shape the shipped judge sends, reproduced so the fixture's prompt
 * exhibit looks like the one a real record carries.
 *
 * Two reasons this is a function rather than two hand-written prompt strings.
 * The criteria and the deliverable appear both as their own exhibits and inside
 * the prompt, so writing the prompt out by hand would let those copies drift —
 * and the prompt is inside the verdict hash while the drift would be invisible
 * on screen. And the structure is the thing worth showing a reviewer: the
 * deliverable arrives fenced and labelled as untrusted, which is what the
 * injection sandbox later demonstrates the effect of.
 *
 * It mirrors `backend/src/ai-judge/prompt.ts` rather than importing it —
 * Requirement 5.1's reasoning applied to the prompt: this workspace does not
 * import from the backend workspace. A fixture is a snapshot of what that module
 * produced, and it stays a snapshot even if the real prompt is reworded.
 *
 * Exported because `app/api/judge/route.ts` builds its prompt exhibit with it
 * too. One spelling of the prompt shape, so a record produced by the mock judge
 * and a record sealed here present the same exhibit to a reader.

Scope: 41,208 active accounts. Accounts that cancelled before 2025-03-01 are excluded, so the rates below are not inflated by churn that had already happened when the window opened.

Segment 1 — Monthly plan, single seat, no integration connected.
Active accounts: 6,740. Churn over the window: 31.4%.
Strongest predictor: days since last login, positive. Accounts idle for 14 days or more leave at 3.1 times the segment's own average.
Action: a one-click re-onboarding email to accounts crossing 14 idle days, sent from the existing lifecycle tool. No engineering work; it is a new trigger on a list that already exists.

Segment 2 — Annual plan in its first renewal window, 2 to 5 seats.
Active accounts: 3,155. Churn over the window: 22.8%.
Strongest predictor: seats invited but never activated, positive. Accounts where fewer than half the purchased seats ever logged in leave at 2.4 times the segment average.
Action: have the account manager run seat activation as a named step 45 days before renewal, using the seat report already on the admin page.

Segment 3 — Accounts that filed two or more support tickets in a 30-day span.
Active accounts: 1,902. Churn over the window: 19.6%.
Strongest predictor: time to first response on the second ticket, positive. Above 26 hours, churn roughly doubles within the segment.
Action: route any second ticket from one account inside 30 days to the front of the queue. This is a routing rule in the existing helpdesk, not a staffing change.

Method note: rates are computed per segment against that segment's own active accounts, not against the whole book, so they do not sum to a portfolio figure.
